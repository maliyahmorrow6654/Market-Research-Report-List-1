<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The noise barrier market consists of two main types: ground-mounted noise barriers and structure-mounted noise barriers. Ground-mounted noise barriers are typically made of materials like concrete or wood and are installed along highways or railways to reduce the impact of noise pollution on nearby communities. On the other hand, structure-mounted noise barriers are attached to existing structures like buildings or bridges to mitigate noise levels within the vicinity. Both types aim to provide a barrier that absorbs or reflects sound waves, thus reducing noise pollution.</p></p>
