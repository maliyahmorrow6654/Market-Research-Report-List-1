<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tube Settlers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PP</li><li>PVC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tube settlers are commonly made from two different types of materials: PP (polypropylene) and PVC (polyvinyl chloride). PP tube settlers are made from a durable, strong plastic material that is resistant to chemicals, making them well-suited for industries that require corrosion resistance. On the other hand, PVC tube settlers are made from a cost-effective plastic material that provides good mechanical strength and is suitable for applications that do not require high chemical resistance. Both PP and PVC tube settlers are used in water treatment processes to enhance sedimentation and increase the settling capacity of water treatment systems.</p></p>
