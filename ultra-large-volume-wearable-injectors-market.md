<p><strong>The Ultra-large Volume Wearable Injectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Body Injectors</li><li>Off-Body Injectors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ultra-large volume wearable injectors are devices used to administer high volumes of medication or therapeutics. Two major types of these injectors are on-body injectors and off-body injectors. On-body injectors are worn directly on the body and usually have a pre-filled syringe attached to the device. Off-body injectors, on the other hand, are connected to the body through a catheter or needle but are not directly worn on the body. Both types allow for convenient and continuous administration of medications, making them beneficial for patients requiring large volume doses.</p></p>
