<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorption Chiller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single effect absorption</li><li>Double effect absorption</li><li>Triple effect absorption</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Absorption Chiller market is categorized into three types: single effect absorption, double effect absorption, and triple effect absorption. In a single effect absorption chiller, a generator absorbs heat from a heat source to produce chilled water. The double effect absorption chiller uses an additional generator to utilize the waste heat produced by the first generator, providing a higher coefficient of performance (COP). Similarly, the triple effect absorption chiller employs two additional generators, making it the most energy-efficient among the three types. These technologies offer varying levels of energy savings and cooling capacities for different applications.</p></p>
