<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SBR Rubber Compound Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>E-SBR</li><li>S-SBR</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The SBR rubber compound market is divided into two types: E-SBR and S-SBR. E-SBR, or Emulsion Styrene Butadiene Rubber, is a synthetic rubber made by the emulsion polymerization of styrene and butadiene. It is widely used in the manufacture of tires and other mechanical rubber goods due to its excellent abrasion resistance. S-SBR, or Solution Styrene Butadiene Rubber, is another type of synthetic rubber produced by the solution polymerization of styrene and butadiene. It is particularly used in high-performance tires as it provides better traction and lower rolling resistance, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.</p></p>
