<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Baggage Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>X-ray</li><li>Millimeter Wave</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Aircraft Baggage Scanners market encompasses two main types of scanning technologies: X-ray and Millimeter Wave scanners. X-ray scanners use electromagnetic radiation to penetrate and capture images of the baggage, enabling the identification of any hidden or prohibited items. Millimeter Wave scanners, on the other hand, employ non-ionizing electromagnetic waves to create detailed images of both the inside and outside of the baggage without exposing passengers to harmful radiation. Both types of scanners play a crucial role in enhancing airport security by thoroughly inspecting and detecting potential threats in luggage.</p></p>
