<p><strong>The Fenspiride Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bronchitis</li><li>Asthma</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fenspiride is commonly used in the treatment of respiratory disorders such as bronchitis, asthma, and other related conditions. Bronchitis is characterized by inflammation of the bronchial tubes, while asthma causes the narrowing of airways, resulting in breathing difficulties. Fenspiride helps by acting as a bronchodilator, relaxing the muscles in the airways and allowing easier breathing. Additionally, it has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce inflammation in the respiratory system. These effects make fenspiride an effective medication for managing bronchitis, asthma, and other respiratory disorders.</p></p>
