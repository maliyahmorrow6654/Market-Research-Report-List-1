<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Utility Microgrids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Microgrid System</li><li>DC Microgrid System</li><li>Hybrid Microgrid System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Utility microgrids include three main types: AC microgrid systems, DC microgrid systems, and Hybrid microgrid systems. AC microgrid systems primarily use alternating current (AC) as their primary power source and are compatible with existing electrical infrastructure. On the other hand, DC microgrid systems rely on direct current (DC) power and are often used in remote areas or for specific applications, such as data centers. Hybrid microgrid systems combine both AC and DC technologies to achieve more efficient and reliable power supply, leveraging the benefits of both systems.</p></p>
