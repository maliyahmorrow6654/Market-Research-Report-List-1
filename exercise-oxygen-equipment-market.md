<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exercise Oxygen Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxygen Concentrators</li><li>Compressed Gas Systems</li><li>Liquid Oxygen Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The exercise oxygen equipment market consists of three types: oxygen concentrators, compressed gas systems, and liquid oxygen systems. Oxygen concentrators are devices that filter and provide pure oxygen from ambient air. Compressed gas systems store oxygen in cylinders, which is then delivered through a regulator and mask. Liquid oxygen systems store oxygen at a low temperature, and it converts to a gas when released through a device called a converter. These equipment types play a vital role in delivering supplemental oxygen to individuals during exercise or physical activity.</p></p>
