<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Indoor Microducts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thick Wall Microducts</li><li>Thin-walled Microducts</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The indoor microducts market consists of two main types: thick wall microducts and thin-walled microducts. Thick wall microducts are designed with thicker walls to provide better protection and insulation for the cables inside. They are commonly used for long-distance installations and higher cable counts. On the other hand, thin-walled microducts have thinner walls and are more flexible, making them ideal for shorter distance installations and installations in tight spaces. Both types play a crucial role in indoor cable management and provide efficient solutions for different installation needs.</p></p>
