<p><p>The play-to-earn NFT games market has experienced remarkable growth across several regions, including North America, APAC (Asia-Pacific), Europe, the United States, and China. North America and Europe have traditionally been dominant players in the global gaming industry, thus we expect them to hold significant market share in play-to-earn NFT games as well. However, APAC, particularly China, is expected to emerge as a formidable force due to its robust gaming culture and large population. The market share valuation for these regions is estimated to be approximately 40% for North America, 30% for Europe, and 25% for APAC, with the remaining 5% for the United States.</p></p>
