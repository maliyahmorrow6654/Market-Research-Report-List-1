<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Sizing Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Type</li><li>Emulsion Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Surface sizing agents are chemicals used in the paper and packaging industry to enhance the surface properties of paper and improve its printability and resistance to moisture. There are two types of surface sizing agents: solution type and emulsion type. </p><p>Solution type agents are water-soluble and are directly added to the paper pulp during manufacturing. They form a thin film on the paper surface, improving its strength and reducing the penetration of ink and moisture. </p><p>Emulsion type agents are added to the paper surface after manufacturing. They are oil-in-water emulsions that create a water-repellent layer on the paper, enhancing its print quality and offering better resistance to liquids.</p></p>
