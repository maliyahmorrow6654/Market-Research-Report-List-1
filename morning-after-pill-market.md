Retail pharmacies account for the largest share in the morning-after pill market, primarily due to the ease of access and availability of these pills at local pharmacies. However, the online segment is expected to witness rapid growth during the forecast period, driven by the increasing popularity and convenience of online purchasing.</p><p>Overall, the morning-after pill market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing awareness, expanding distribution channels, and the need for effective emergency contraception options.
