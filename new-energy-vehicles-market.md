<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Energy Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HEV</li><li>PHEV</li><li>EV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) are categorized into three main types: Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and Electric Vehicles (EVs). HEVs combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. PHEVs feature both an internal combustion engine and a rechargeable battery, allowing them to operate purely on electricity for shorter distances. EVs, on the other hand, are fully electric vehicles that rely solely on battery power, producing zero tailpipe emissions. These different types cater to varying consumer needs and preferences in terms of range and charging capabilities.</p></p>
