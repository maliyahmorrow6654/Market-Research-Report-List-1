<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venous Stent</li><li>Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Device</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Device market consists of two main types of devices: Venous Stent and Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) Device. Venous Stent is a medical device used to treat narrowing or blockage in the veins caused by DVT. It is a small mesh-like tube that is inserted into the affected vein to keep it open and allow blood flow. On the other hand, IPC Device is a non-invasive device that helps prevent blood clot formation by applying intermittent pressure to the legs, stimulating blood circulation and reducing the risk of DVT.</p></p>
