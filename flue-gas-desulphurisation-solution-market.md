<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue Gas Desulphurisation Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet FGD</li><li>Dry and Semi-Dry FGD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) solutions are used to remove sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from flue gases produced by power plants and industrial processes. There are three main types of FGD solutions: wet FGD, dry FGD, and semi-dry FGD. </p><p>The wet FGD system involves spraying a liquid sorbent (such as limestone slurry) into the flue gas, which reacts with the SO2 to form sulphuric acid. The acidic solution is then neutralized, resulting in a gypsum byproduct. </p><p>The dry FGD system relies on a dry sorbent (such as lime or sodium bicarbonate) injected into the flue gas, absorbing and reacting with the SO2 to form solid byproducts. This process creates a dry powder that is easier to handle and dispose of compared to wet FGD.</p><p>The semi-dry FGD system combines elements of both wet and dry methods. It uses a spray dryer to inject a sorbent slurry into the flue gas, which dries the gas and produces a dry powder for further reactions with SO2. This approach offers a compromise between the efficiency of wet FGD and the lower costs of dry FGD.</p></p>
