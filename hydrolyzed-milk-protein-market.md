<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrolyzed Milk Protein  Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Whey</li><li>Casein</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydrolyzed milk protein is a type of protein derived from milk that undergoes a process called hydrolysis. This process breaks down the protein into smaller peptides, making it easier for the body to digest and absorb. The hydrolyzed milk protein market includes two main types: whey and casein. Whey protein is obtained from the liquid part of milk and is quickly absorbed by the body, making it ideal for post-workout recovery. Casein protein, on the other hand, is obtained from the solid part of milk and is slowly digested, providing a steady release of amino acids over time.</p></p>
