<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Pendulum Accelerometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type</li><li>Piezoresistive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flexible pendulum accelerometers are devices used to measure acceleration in various applications. Piezoelectric type accelerometers rely on the principle that when a piezoelectric material is subjected to mechanical stress, it generates an electrical charge proportional to the applied acceleration. These sensors are highly sensitive, capable of detecting even slight vibrations. On the other hand, piezoresistive type accelerometers measure acceleration through changes in electrical resistance. They utilize a flexible element with resistors that change their resistance when subject to acceleration, providing accurate measurements. Both types cater to different market needs and require specialized integration for different applications.</p></p>
