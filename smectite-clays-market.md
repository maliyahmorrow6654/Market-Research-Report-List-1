<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smectite Clays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sodium Bentonite</li><li>Calcium Bentonite</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Smectite clays market is divided into two main types: sodium bentonite and calcium bentonite. Sodium bentonite is a highly swelling clay that is commonly used in industrial applications such as drilling muds, sealants, and foundry molds. It has excellent water retention properties and can expand up to several times its original size. On the other hand, calcium bentonite has similar properties to sodium bentonite but with lower swelling capacity. It is primarily used for its absorbent qualities in cat litter, agriculture, and soil remediation applications.</p></p>
