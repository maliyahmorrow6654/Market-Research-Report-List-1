<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck engine brake market comprises two main types: compression release brake and exhaust brake. A compression release brake works by releasing compressed air from the cylinders during the exhaust stroke, creating resistance and slowing down the engine. This type is effective for downhill driving as it provides strong braking power. On the other hand, an exhaust brake restricts the exhaust flow, causing backpressure in the cylinders and utilizing the engine's compression to slow down the vehicle. It is more suitable for flat terrain and less steep descents.</p></p>
