<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multibeam Echo Sounders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Frequency</li><li>Medium Frequency</li><li>High Frequency</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multibeam echo sounders are used in various industries to measure water depths and map the seafloor. They operate at different frequencies, namely low frequency (typically below 24 kHz), medium frequency (24-50 kHz), and high frequency (above 50 kHz). Low frequency systems provide better penetration through sediment and yield greater depth coverage, making them suitable for deep-water applications. Medium frequency systems offer a balance between penetration and resolution and are commonly used in coastal surveys. High frequency systems offer high-resolution images but limited depth penetration, making them ideal for shallow water surveys and nearshore mapping.</p></p>
