<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polycarbonate(PC) Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosgene type</li><li>Non-Phosgene type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Polycarbonate(PC) Resin market is categorized into two types: Phosgene type and Non-Phosgene type. The Phosgene type refers to the production process where phosgene gas is reacted with a dihydroxy compound to create polycarbonate. Phosgene, although efficient, can be hazardous to handle. On the other hand, the Non-Phosgene type utilizes a different method that eliminates the need for phosgene gas, resulting in a safer production process. This type usually involves the reaction of dimethyl carbonate and dihydroxy compounds to produce polycarbonate.</p></p>
