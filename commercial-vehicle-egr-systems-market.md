<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle EGR Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric EGR Valve</li><li>Pneumatic EGR Valve</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Commercial vehicle EGR systems are designed to reduce harmful emissions from vehicles. There are two types of EGR valves commonly used in these systems: Electric EGR valves and Pneumatic EGR valves. Electric EGR valves are controlled electronically, providing precise control of exhaust recirculation. This allows for more accurate emissions reduction and better engine performance. Pneumatic EGR valves, on the other hand, are controlled by air pressure. While less precise than electric valves, pneumatic EGR valves are more cost-effective and reliable for commercial vehicles. Both types of valves contribute to a cleaner and more efficient operation of commercial vehicles.</p></p>
