<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Infusion Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Pressure Infusor</li><li>Automatic Pressure Infusor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pressure infusion devices are used to administer fluids and medications to patients quickly and efficiently. Manual pressure infusors require manual squeezing to generate pressure, making them cost-effective but dependent on the user's strength. On the other hand, automatic pressure infusors use an electric or battery-powered mechanism to generate pressure, offering consistent and controlled infusion rates with minimal effort. While manual pressure infusors are suitable for low-volume settings, automatic pressure infusors are more commonly used in high-volume settings such as hospitals and emergency departments.</p></p>
