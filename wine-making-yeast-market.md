<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wine-Making Yeast Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Yeast Extract</li><li>Autolyzed Yeast</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wine-making yeast market encompasses two types of yeast products: yeast extract and autolyzed yeast. Yeast extract is derived from the cellular contents of yeast, typically including proteins, vitamins, and minerals. It is commonly used as a flavor enhancer and nutrient source in the wine-making process. Autolyzed yeast, on the other hand, undergoes a natural self-degradation process, releasing various compounds such as amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars. Autolyzed yeast is used primarily for its flavor-enhancing properties and to promote fermentation in wine production.</p></p>
