<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Rated Ductwork System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated</li><li>Non-coated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fire-rated ductwork system market comprises two main types: coated and non-coated. Coated ductwork systems are manufactured with a fire-resistant coating, which provides additional protection against fires. This coating helps to prevent the spread of fire and smoke throughout a building by containing the flames within the ductwork. On the other hand, non-coated ductwork systems do not have a fire-resistant coating and rely on other fire safety measures within the building. These types of ductwork systems may be less expensive but offer lower fire protection compared to coated systems.</p></p>
