<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spherical Bridge Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Type</li><li>Guided Type</li><li>Free Sliding Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Spherical Bridge Bearing market is categorized into three types: fixed type, guided type, and free sliding type. The fixed type bearings do not allow any movement, providing stability and support to the bridge. Guided type bearings enable limited movement, guiding the bridge without allowing it to completely slide. Free sliding type bearings allow unrestricted movement, facilitating the expansion and contraction of the bridge due to temperature changes. These types cater to different bridge requirements, providing varying levels of movement and support to ensure optimal bridge functionality.</p></p>
