<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Addition Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radical Polymerization</li><li>Cationic Polymerization</li><li>Negative Ion Polymerization</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Addition polymerization is a process where monomers join together to form a polymer chain. Several types exist, including radical polymerization, cationic polymerization, and negative ion polymerization. In radical polymerization, the initiation step involves the generation of free radicals which then react with monomers to form chains. Cationic polymerization relies on the use of a catalyst that produces a carbocation which initiates the polymerization process. Negative ion polymerization involves the use of negatively charged species to start the reaction. Apart from these, there are other addition polymerization markets that encompass various techniques used for polymerization, such as living polymerization and ring-opening polymerization.</p></p>
