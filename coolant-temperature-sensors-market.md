<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coolant Temperature Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-Wire Coolant Temperature Sensors</li><li>1-Wire Coolant Temperature Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Coolant Temperature Sensors market includes two types: 2-Wire Coolant Temperature Sensors and 1-Wire Coolant Temperature Sensors. 2-Wire sensors have two wires that provide information about the coolant temperature to the engine control unit (ECU) for precise monitoring. They are commonly used in modern vehicles. On the other hand, 1-Wire sensors have only one wire that provides both power supply and temperature signals to the ECU. They are generally found in older vehicles or those with simpler systems. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining engine temperature and overall performance.</p></p>
